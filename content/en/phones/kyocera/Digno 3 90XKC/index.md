# Kyocera Digno 3 902KC/903KC.
![Alt text](902KC3__71796.jpg)
The Kyocera Digno 3 Ketai 902KC/903KC model, referred to collectively as the 90X, is a 2020 flip phone manufactured by Kyocera, a Japanese electronics company. The 90X is praised by digital minimalists as a capable android feature phone, and one of the few that works with western carriers (almost) out of the box.

## Software Support
The 90XKC runs Android 8.1, and is lower-spec. Some modern apps and google services
won't work, but this is considered a good thing if you're purchasing for privacy or digital minimalism.

Luckily, the 90XKC has APK Support. You'll need to manually find and install APKs and install them using ADB. It's recommended you visit our [APKs](/en/introduction/apks/) page.

Most modern and unoptimized apps will work very slowly due to the low-spec, and the small-screen and lack of arrow navigation on some apps will force you to use the pointer in an awkward way.

## Specifications
At a glance, 90XKC features USB-C charging, Android 8.1 and Wifi 2.4GHz and Bluetooth 4.2.
